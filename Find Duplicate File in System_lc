#how I was thinking, but this causes value overrides sin some cases where the contents are the the ame 
#build the same_files and path_holder simultanously
        #split the element -> iterate through this array -> path_holder[splited[i]] = splited[0] -> then same_files[splited[i].find("("):].append(splited[i][:splited[i].find("(")]) -> iterae over same_files then build the ans array by concatinating the root from path_holder and the key of the same_files
